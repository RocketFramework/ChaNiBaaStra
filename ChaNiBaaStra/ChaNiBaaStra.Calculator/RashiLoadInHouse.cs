This shows that spouse may be working in a high authority position in Large Organizations or with some group of people with a higher cause. But as Mars is still in enemy sign, it shows that spouse has sudden bursts of anger in relationship or even at work place. They may still try to dominate the native. ";

Here Spouse is an action oriented and motivated person. They get good wealth from Foreign Lands. At right time, they settle in Foreign Lands. Profession of Spouse would be similar like in Health Care and Law Enforcement. Additionally, this can make a person an Athlete who travels Foreign Lands to compete with others.

They feel that other people are more blessed than them. They need a mentor on daily basis to remind them how blessed they are. As Ketu is in Taurus, it shows that these people are not too much about hoarding wealth and possessions in life. They will be disinterested towards money aspect of life. ";

As Ketu isolates/separates a person from the things related to the house Ketu is sitting, here it actually separates person from the concept of hoarding and gaining wealth. And that's why, people with Ketu in 2nd or 11th house end up as the richest people in the world because whatever you don't care for in life comes very easy to you. They don't care for wealth, so wealth comes easy. Ketu in 2nd house also becomes a karaka of 2nd marriage, so best way to avoid any such situation is to marry your spouse twice. It may also give a malefic speech to person. They feel isolation from family too, like both sides are unable to understand each other's point of view. It may also send person away from family in early childhood. Ketu in Gemini also shows someone not too much communicative or business minded. ";

They never find the balance in relationship with siblings. At the same time, they remain concerned for their siblings. This person may not be too interested in running a business. They may also not be too willing to travel around. Ketu in Cancer also shows someone not getting proper love from mother. ";

These people are either physically separated from their mother or they feel a mental separation always. They always feel that their mother is unable to understand their point of view or vice versa. They feel that their mother was unfair to them. As Ketu is in Leo in 4th house, this person is away from all creative endeavors of life. He is happy with the routine life and doesn't want to follow the creative pursuits. They may not buy a property in their own name if they want to reside in it. At the same time, this position gives high intuition powers. This position is one of Moksha Margi position, means these people can get enlightenment and liberation if they make effort. ";

As Ketu isolates/separates a person from the things related to the house Ketu is sitting, here Creativity suffers. These people are either physically separated from being creative and attaining higher education, means they themselves won't be motivated to study any further after basic education. Likewise, they are not too much into sports, not even as a kid. Love relations would always end in painful breakups or cheating, so much so that later they won't even be inclined to any love relation. A benefic planet with Ketu or its aspect on Ketu/5th house or a running dasha of another planet can change this scenario completely. As Ketu is in Virgo, it means they are not much into digging details and being perfect about things. They feel isolated from any act of being analytical and critical. ";

As Ketu isolates/separates a person from the things related to the house Ketu is sitting, here it separates person from the concept of as to where he is serving. It means these people are blind as to where they are working, if they are getting enough return/salary/bonus for their work. They just want to mechanically work without any thought of getting into office politics and other things. Hence, it so happens that they may not get their deserving dues in jobs. It also separates them from concepts of Competition. They are the last people who want to get into any dispute. They live a healthy life, as they are also separated from Diseases. Ketu ruling 7th house of relations and sitting in sign of Libra of relationships, surely suggests some testing times in relations, during certain dasha and transits. Here, Ketu's 2nd nature of being Spiritual is going to help. The more spiritual couple is, the more prosperous will be married life. ";

They are not one of those who are looking out for their first or next partner. They are quite content and spiritual about themselves and their relations. It remains a possibility with Ketu in 7th house always that person is disinterested towards relations. The only way relation can survive in such cases is that couple becomes highly spiritual in matters of relations, means they are happy with whomsoever they marry with no expectations at all. Conjunction/Aspect of a benefic planet may change the situation altogether. At the same time, they may be highly investigative about the occult side of life. ";

Concept of Govt, Boss, Power and Authority is alien to them. It is better for them to work for themselves. It also separates person from his Gurus and Higher Learning, means this person will always find Gurus who are in disagreement with native. There is never a connect between the two. Native thinks that real knowledge of religion and philosophy is something else then what is taught to him by his Gurus. He always feels that his teachers are below par.";

Relationship with Father is not to talk about. Either they are physically separated from Father or they never find that mental connect with him. It is better for these people to either work for themselves and be their own authority or follow a spiritual career. They are the last people who are looking for any authority over any other.";

They never find themselves agree with the concepts of spirituality of others and always find fault there. Similarly, they reach foreign land but don't find anything of interest there and feel isolated. It is one of the most prominent Moksha Margi position.

Best thing to avoid any trouble in relations whenever Saturn gets connected with 7th house or 7th house lord is to delay marriage till 30 at least.

Saturn being the ruler of 7th house means marriage must be delayed till 30s to get good results of Saturn. Early marriage may not be too prosperous. Higher Learning or Guru will come with delay in life. Till then, they will be just finding wrong persons as Gurus. They will have doubts and criticism towards their Gurus. They can ask about genuineness of even a Spiritual Guru. It is very hard for them to find a real guru in 1st part of life.

It shows person had real struggle with any authority figure in life. Even a watchman will show him attitude when time is wrong. This shows someone making a career in Law or Govt Administration. They can also become a Judge but all good things related with Saturn comes when they are in their 30s. Before that it is only a struggle to find out why everyone around them has so much attitude over their authority? In marriage matters, the marriage should be delayed till 30s at least. Any relation before that will end up as burden and responsibility. If Saturn is in Aries here for Cancer Ascendant where it is debilitated, the results may even be more intense.

Their earnings come really slow earlier but it gradually improves. Money doesn't come easy in life when Saturn is involved. They have to work their ass-off to gain in any field.

Best thing to avoid any trouble in relations whenever Saturn gets connected with 7th house or 7th house lord is to delay marriage till 30 at least.

Saturn being the ruler of 7th house means marriage must be delayed till 30s to get good results of Saturn. Early marriage may not be too prosperous. Higher Learning or Guru will come with delay in life. Till then, they will be just finding wrong persons as Gurus. They will have doubts and criticism towards their Gurus. They can ask about genuineness of even a Spiritual Guru. It is very hard for them to find a real guru in 1st part of life.

They can also become a Judge but all good things related with Saturn comes when they are in their 30s. Before that it is only a struggle to find out why everyone around them has so much attitude over their authority? In marriage matters, the marriage should be delayed till 30s at least. Any relation before that will end up as burden and responsibility. If Saturn is in Aries here for Cancer Ascendant where it is debilitated, the results may even be more intense.

There is never a connect between the two. Native thinks that real knowledge of religion and philosophy is something else then what is taught to him by his Gurus.

For Gemini Ascendant, they won't leave their mother's company at least till mid 30s but they may be taken away from Family. These people taste success only after the toughest of labor. Saturn doesn't give anything easily in life and here the family and wealth are getting delayed. ";

Likewise, relations with in-laws are stressful to start with but slowly improve and get much better after mid-30s. Joint Assets with spouse also will improve gradually.

But if delayed, it will be a stable relation based on practicalities of life. Spouse will be of elderly age, matured and very realistic/practical about life. Spouse may be working for Govt or Law Field. Here, it gives a spouse who is of strict religious views and beliefs and this strictness brings all the troubles in relationships. So, person must delay the marriage till 30s at least in this case. ";

Likewise, relations with in-laws are stressful to start with but slowly improve and get much better after mid-30s. Joint Assets with spouse also will improve gradually. These people can be working in Govt or Law related field in which they have to serve people facing sudden events, so law enforcement or army people who help during natural calamities can be seen from here. Additionally, any work related with mining is good for them. They will get some real harsh and strict Gurus in early life but as they grow older they get old and wise Gurus. ";

Till then, they will be just finding Gurus, who are just to strict and who wants them to follow some stringent rules and regulations. They will have doubts and criticism towards their Gurus. They can ask about genuineness of even a Spiritual Guru. It is very hard for them to find a real guru in 1st part of life. This can also delay their higher education in 1st part of life. Access to far distant land may be blocked till mid life. But as always with Saturn, after attaining 30, they are more open towards developing a right belief system. At right time, they also get the right Guru and they find the true knowledge. Then they will find Gurus who show other nature of Saturn, i.e. Old and Wise. ";

It shows person had real struggle with any authority figure in life. Even a watchman will show him attitude when time is wrong. This shows someone making a career in Law or Govt Administration. They can also become a Judge but all good things related with Saturn comes when they are in their 30s. Before that it is only a struggle to find out why everyone around them has so much attitude over their authority? In marriage matters, the marriage should be delayed till 30s at least. Any relation before that will end up as burden and responsibility. Married life in true meanings start after mid 30s. Till then, marriage is more of a restrictive relation and responsibility. ";

They may not have big network circle or elder siblings, or even if they have, they will never gain benefit out of them. Even if they have money early in life, it will be taken away due to some sudden event. It becomes a greater possibility for Gemini Ascendant people as Saturn will be debilitated. In that case, person has to make double effort to make money. Career wise, this shows someone in Law field as Saturn, 9th house both represent Law. Alternatively, they can be in fields related with Saturn like oiling, iron, mining etc. As always, things get better with Saturn from 30s. So, till 30, it is time for patience and hard work. In 30s, they gain a lot from any work related with Insurance, Inheritance and due to any business related with underground things like Coal, Iron, Oil and Mines.";

They always have this sense of under achievement in their life. In this position, person has a very serious outlook towards life. They always want to be in discipline and keep everyone in order. For Aries Ascendants, Saturn is debilitated. So, the struggle to find the right path becomes much more difficult/stressful till mid 30s. As Saturn aspects 7th house, Marriage should be delayed and person will get a spouse who will bring responsibility, serious outlook and focus in person's life. Here relationship is not about Bollywood Romance but real serious stuff like burdens of marriage. Romance takes a back seat here. They are not one of those fun loving people.

They see such dearth of money and lack of good family environment in early life that they realize the value of money early in life, hence in 2nd part of life they are going to be very cautious about money. These people taste success only after the toughest of labor. Saturn doesn't give anything easily in life and here the family and wealth are getting delayed. These people can be Lawyers or working in Govt or Large Organization. For Pisces Ascendants, Saturn is debilitated in Aries, hence it makes money making even more difficult. ";

When they write, they can write heaviest of books or lengthiest of Articles. Person won't have good relations with younger siblings till mid 30s . From mid 30s he ends up having his own work.

They treat education as their duty/responsibility and in such cases, fun part of life takes a back seat. It shows some real stressful relations which become burden in early 20s and break with time. Saturn here gives long duration relations and then it breaks, so the pain of separation is long lasting. They realize their creative side only in 30s. Saturn's 3rd aspect delays the marriage and hence child birth also gets delayed. Overall, it is a position of person who is seriously involved in studies and willing to leave fun part of life at least in 20s. Education may be delayed or blocked for some time.

Another Career it can give is Lawyer if it gets connected with 10th house along with 6th house.

Saturn in 6th house is one of best placement for Saturn as it impacts all the Dushthana Houses, i.e. 6th, 8th and 12th house and hence limits the results of these houses.

But if delayed, it will be a stable relation based on practicalities of life. Spouse will be of elderly age, matured and very realistic/practical about life. Spouse/Person may be working for Govt or Law Field or a Businessman. Business may be related with Iron, Steel etc. So, person must delay the marriage till 30s at least in this case. For Aries Ascendant, Saturn will be exalted, so situations will be little better. Spouse/Person can be a Businessman/Lawyer. Bollywood Romance won't work here.

Joint Assets with spouse also will improve gradually. These people can be working in Govt or Law related field, or in works related to Petrol, Iron etc, in which they have to serve people facing sudden events. Additionally, any work related with mining is good for them. For Aries Ascendants, Earning and Relation with Elder Siblings will be transformative.

Till then, they will be finding Gurus, who are just too strict and who wants them to follow some stringent rules and regulations. They will have doubts and criticism towards their Gurus. They can ask about genuineness of even a Spiritual Guru. It is very hard for them to find a real guru in 1st part of life. This can also delay their higher education in 1st part of life. Access to far distant land may be blocked till mid life. But as always with Saturn, after attaining 30, they are more open towards developing a right belief system. At right time, they also get the right Guru and they find the true knowledge. Then they will find Gurus who show other nature of Saturn, i.e. Old and Wise. Long Distance travel will come late in life but when they travel, they will travel for a long time. Career wise, Law is the best option for them. They will be quite strict towards their beliefs. ";

For Aquarius Ascendant, Saturn will be in Leo, sign of arch-enemy Sun. It may indicate a real stressful relation. Spouse/Person can be a Businessman/Lawyer. Bollywood Romance won't work here.

Till then, they will be finding Gurus, who are just too strict and who wants them to follow some stringent rules and regulations. They will have doubts and criticism towards their Gurus. They can ask about genuineness of even a Spiritual Guru. It is very hard for them to find a real guru in 1st part of life. This can also delay their higher education in 1st part of life. Access to far distant land may be blocked till mid life. But as always with Saturn, after attaining 30, they are more open towards developing a right belief system. At right time, they also get the right Guru and they find the true knowledge. Then they will find Gurus who show other nature of Saturn, i.e. Old and Wise. Long Distance travel will come late in life but when they travel, they will travel for a long time. Career wise, Law is the best option for them. They will be quite strict towards their beliefs.

It shows person had real struggle with any authority figure in life. Even a watchman will show him attitude when time is wrong. This shows someone making a career in Law or Govt Administration or in high position at Corporate. Person himself and/or father can be a strict disciplinarian. So, colleagues wont like them much. They can also become a Judge but all good things related with Saturn comes when they are in their 30s. Before that it is only a struggle to find out why everyone around them has so much attitude over their authority? Earning grows slowly and steadily in life. In marriage matters, the marriage should be delayed till 30s at least. Any relation before that will end up as burden and responsibility. Married life in true meanings start after mid 30s.

They see such dearth of money and lack of good family environment in early life that they realize the value of money early in life, hence in 2nd part of life they are going to be very cautious about money. These people taste success only after the toughest of labor. Saturn doesn't give anything easily in life and here the family and wealth are getting delayed. These people can be Lawyers or working in Govt or Large Organization.

When they write, they can write heaviest of books or lengthiest of Articles. Person won't have good relations with younger siblings till mid 30s . From mid 30s he ends up having his own work.

They treat education as their duty/responsibility and in such cases, fun part of life takes a back seat. It shows some real stressful relations which become burden in 20s and break with time. Saturn here gives long duration relations and then it breaks, so the pain of separation is long lasting. Loss of 12th house is coming to 5th house of Romance. They realize their creative side only in 30s. Saturn's 3rd aspect delays the marriage and hence child birth also gets delayed. Overall, it is a position of person who is seriously involved in studies and willing to leave fun part of life at least in 20s. Education may be delayed or blocked for some time or they may have to repeat a class at sometime. They should make their Career in Education, Law, Govt etc. Career in Creative field will only happen in their 30s. ";

Till then, they will be finding Gurus, who are just too strict and who wants them to follow some stringent rules and regulations. They will have doubts and criticism towards their Gurus. They can ask about genuineness of even a Spiritual Guru. It is very hard for them to find a real guru in 1st part of life. This can also delay their higher education in 1st part of life. Access to far distant land may be blocked till mid life. But as always with Saturn, after attaining 30, they are more open towards developing a right belief system. At right time, they also get the right Guru and they find the true knowledge. Then they will find Gurus who show other nature of Saturn, i.e. Old and Wise. Long Distance travel will come late in life but when they travel, they will travel for a long time. Career wise, Law is the best option for them. They will be quite strict towards their beliefs. For Aquarius Ascendant, Saturn will be exalted here, so things may be little easy but nothing more than that. ";

They can also become a Judge but all good things related with Saturn comes when they are in their 30s. Before that it is only a struggle to find out why everyone around them has so much attitude over their authority? Earning grows slowly and steadily in life. In marriage matters, the marriage should be delayed till 30s at least. Any relation before that will end up as burden and responsibility. Married life in true meanings start after mid 30s. Till then, marriage is more of a restrictive relation and responsibility. . ";
